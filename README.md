# tetrisPLUS
A simple reinterpretation of Tetris, visualized in Processing

What at first glance looks like a tetris clone is exactly thatâ€”but with a twist! Instead of filling in blocks in a
top-to-bottom direction, the player gets to place a block anywhere in the 10x10 grid, allowing for unique puzzle
patterns and solutions. Clear lines in any direction, at your own speed; this is currently a sandbox for a puzzle
game experience, any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated and strongly encouraged.

The point of the game as a project is to recreate a preexisting game, then change the underlying structure while 
still maintaining the well-understood rules.

Current features: 
- Vertical line clearing
- Next Block Indicator
- Simple Scoring

Intended/Upcoming Features:
- Increased number of play modes (imagine clearing "rings" instead of lines)
- Complex Scoring
- Updated UX

Arrow Keys (Move) + Shift (Rotate) + Enter/Return (Confirm)
