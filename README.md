# tetris
A simple reinterpretation of Tetris, visualized in Processing

What at first glance looks like a tetris clone is exactly thatâ€”but with a twist! Instead of filling in blocks in a  top-to-bottom direction, the player gets to place a block anywhere in the 10x10 grid, allowing for unique puzzle 		patterns and solutions. Clear lines in any direction, at your own speed; this is currently a sandbox for a puzzle game experience, any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated and strongly encouraged.
